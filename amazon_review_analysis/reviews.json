{"name":"litezen","date":"2012-11-08 00:00:00","text":"I normally don't bother to review stuff, but I am very impressed with this torch and want to share some information that could be useful to others.There are multiple sellers for this item, and I suspect that the item quality may vary depending on the seller and the source\/timing of their stock. I bought mine from Warm Mart around Oct 20. The item is shipped from Hong Kong, and took 2.5 weeks to arrive.This little torch looks more expensive than the $5 I paid for it. It's made from metal, heavy (for its size), and has a tactical bezel that looks like it can be used to break glass.The orange switch works reliably. There are other versions of this torch out there that has multiple settings - high, low, strobe. The one I received only has 2 settings though - on and off.It only requires a single AA battery, which is nice. It works great with rechargeable NiMH batteries. I tried an Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable battery on the torch and left the light on to see how long it'll last - it lasted more that 4 hours on a single charge! I don't know exactly how long it lasted as I gave up checking after 4 hours. What's also amazing is that the brightness stays pretty constant over 3+ hours. Regular torchlights tend to get dimmer as its battery drains - not this one.How bright is this torchlight? I have other LED torchlights for comparison - i.e. a typical pocket LED torch with 9 LEDs, running on 3xAAA and sells for a few dollars. This torchlight blows that one away - it's at least a couple of times brighter. It also emits a bright white light instead of the bluish-white light that other LED torchlights produce.This torch also has a bezel that you can move in or out, to adjust the beam. On the 'wide' setting, it produces a very evenly lit circular spot. When used in the dark, the 'beam' setting will easily light up something that's 50+ feet away. The 'beam' setting looks strange though as it produces a squarish spot that is essentially an image of the Cree LED's surface.It puts my other regular LED torches to shame. Wife initially balked when I bought another torchlight; when I turned it on, she wants me to buy a few more! A friend that I've shown it to now wants to get one.","score":5.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

A 14500 cell is the same size as your average AA battery, but provides almost twice the power and are also rechargeable.  IMPORTANT: If you decide to purchase a 14500 cell PLEASE buy a high quality one such as AW brand and make sure it is a PROTECTED 14500 CELL, and stay away from the xxxxxfire brands commonly found on eBay as these cells can be very dangerous.

As any flashaholic knows, a flashlight is personal, especially one of few that gets carried around every day.  I think I like the feel and the grip and the wide flood the most.  Highly recommend!Now on to the more practical part of the review so people can make an educated decision:- This indeed runs well and bright on a Liion 3.7V 14500 battery and is much brighter- The 14500 battery doesn't last long; in fact it lasts a bit less than my 10440 in my Tank 703- The zoom becomes a bit loose after a while but not in a bad way, just easier to move and more prone to move when you don't want it.- Mine arrive in full working order, my father in law's arrived Dead and he had to RMA it.  Set your expectations low and you will be surprised.- When zoomed out it is a great soft and beautiful flood light.  When zoomed in to around 80% it is nice and focused and a good beam pattern with soft edges.  When fully zoomed in it is a large magnification of the emitter and an ugly square with lines just like the emitter is.  It doesn't bother me but should be stated for those purists out there that look strongly at beam pattern.- It is a little heavy light for its size and quite thick compared to most 14500 lights but also feels short (don't think it is though).  It feels more like a CR123 light.  Kinda cool and refreshing- Reverse clicky (what would you expect for $5) but it is a good tailcap that can stand.- Threads are fairly smooth but the spring catches as you unscrew and makes it feel gritty when it really isn't.- Anodizing is surprisingly strong as I have it in my pocket with lots of other metal lights and knives and all the rest are now black and silver were the coating has rubbed off this is solid and nothing has come off in several months.  Impressive!Overall it isn't the most competent light on the planet and a far cry from a high-end fenix light but for $5 and all the things it does right I would highly recommend it.  Worst case it is a conversation piece, best case it becomes your new EDC like me.","score":5.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

Well, there certainly is, but it isn't very effective. I used two batteries: a 2600 mAh 1.2V AA and a 900 mAh 3.7V 14500. If you do the math, you find that those batteries can deliver about equal power. But, the AA battery makes the light significantly dimmer. That means that the regulator isn't doing its job - if the flashlight was truly designed for both battery types, the regulator would drive the LED at the same voltage regardless of battery type. What happened here is probably that the light was designed for a Li-ion 14500 and someone noticed that it happens to work with an AA as well.

Well, I'm happy to say that it was brighter than expected and absolutely outshines any of the inexpensive, single-battery LED flashlights I've purchased over the last few years. It also is much brighter than the 8 or 9-LED models that use three AAA batteries. The light has a bit of a bluish tint, but not annoyingly so, by any means. With the adjustable lens fully forward, this baby will project a small, rectangular beam of light for over a hundred feet. Bring the lens back and it becomes a nice flood light. As others have mentioned, the lens just slides back and forth rather than staying in a secured position as it would if it were threaded. However, you'll likely not be using it much as a spotlight, anyway, due to the narrow beam.There apparently are several types out there that look virtually identical and what I was expecting was the single on\/off variety. What I actually received was the one that gives full brightness, off, reduced brightness, off, strobe and off for each push of the tail switch. Although this is an ordinary locking, click-on\/click-off switch, there apparently is some circuitry that keeps track of the number of times the contacts open and close in a short period of time. In ordinary use, the light will always come on at full brightness and go off with the next push, just like a regular flashlight. I also tested it with a battery that was getting weak and, although dimmer, it still produced plenty of lightAt 3.2 oz (with battery), this is heavier than I expected and is also fatter than other 1-AA lights. It appears to be quite rugged and that also goes for the clip, which is fastened by two screws. Not sure I'd want to carry this in a pocket for long periods of time--maybe on a belt, though.

The Coleman is bigger and uses 3 AAA cells instead of one AA, and focuses the beam with a rotating collar instead of a push-pull sliding one.  The Coleman's light is rather bluish and the light from this Sodial is much more pleasant.  The only thing about it that doesn't beat the Coleman is the size of the lighted area at the widest beam setting.  The Sodial is smaller, lighter, just as bright, a bit easier to adjust the beam, has a clip and is a quarter of the price.  And it has bright, dim and flashing settings which you switch by pushing the button halfway.Overall - - Excellent.","score":5.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

The picture on the product page....well, that person obviously has a very small hand, but the flashlight is still pretty tiny. It's about three inches from tip to tip. It takes one AA battery. I dont really use the adjustable focus, but a feature I really appreciate is the flashing light setting, achieved by half depressing the button. This is eminently useful when walking across the street when it's dark and there are cars around. A driver cant help but notice you. As far as the actual light output, it is very, very bright. I use this when I leave for work to walk down the stairs and out the driveway. It is obviously also very handy around the house. The only knock on this at all in my opinion is the belt clip. You will need to loosen the bolts, which honestly kind of defeats the purpose. Without doing so, you'll never get it open enough to clip onto anything.Anyway, for the $8 or so this currently runs at, I dont feel like you're gonna find something better.One final note....it's very stout, and you could use it as a weapon in a pinch.

Perfect pocket size, incredible design (military style), very durable (I dropped it many times and it still works), and very bright. I love the modes (full power, dimmed, and the strobe). Never seen a flashlight before with this type of adjustable focus (by \"stretching\" the flashlight), which I liked, too. It's been working on a single AA battery flawlessly for 3 months now (I use it for about 10 minutes a day, everyday). It's also very functional - I use it (actually two of them) for a night bicycle riding. I mounted them on the handlebar using rubber brackets (also available on Amazon for a few bucks) and it feels like I have two powerful headlights. The only minor thing that I would change about this flashlight is the mode sequence. If you are using a dimmed mode and you turn off the flashlight, and then you turn it on again, it goes to the next preset setting, which is a strobe light. I wish it stayed on dimmed. It's still my favorite flashlight, though. It beats many of my $40-$50 flashlights.I was also considering the Ultrafire 1000 Lumen Cree 501b T6 LED Flashlight Torch (similar design) for only $5 more, but they come without the batteries. I did some research and found out that a decent charger with reliable batteries cost around $50. It would be probably to big to carry it in my pocket anyway, so I'm going to stick with this perfect little thing.Even if it stops working tomorrow, I'm still going to give it five stars and order a new one. Even if it means ordering a new one every three months. Still worth every penny.","score":5.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

They came in these little white boxes, covered with a bubble wrap bag, and had the high,low and strobe capability. The next two orders still had the boxes, but the adjustable light capability was gone. The light was either on or off now. That was OK as the quality of the unit was still high. This last order, and I emphasize last order, was crap.I received the padded envelope in the mail and could tell something was different from the prior mailings. I cut open the pouch and there were no more little white boxes. Each light was only covered by the little bubble wrap bag that was in the boxes of prior shipments. This prompted me to look further. I have at least one of the lights from each of the prior orders and I compared them this final order. I noticed a pronounced drop in the quality of the light.The sliding tube that holds the lens that focuses the light beam is very loose compared to my other lights. The on\/off button seems cheaper. Even the spring on the button is smaller than my other lights. The final test I did was to compare the light beams with an older purchase using the same battery in each light. The beam produced by the new light seemed to be less intense and the focus was not as precise as on the older model.The prior versions were a great buy for around 5 bucks. The current run is not. My suggestion is that you don't waste your money on these lights. My bet is that they will not last as long as the prior batch. I will keep this final purchase as it would cost as much as I paid for them to ship them back to China. My guess is that the cost of doing business in China is going up so the quality of their products will be decreasing.

They are metal and while the construction may be a bit crude (screws holding the clip on), they don't feel cheap.Secondly, the all worked.  I read where a few people got inoperable ones, but I put AA batteries in all five and they worked as promised.Thirdly, they are bright.  Well, bright enough.  They don't rival the much more expensive flashlight I primarily use on duty (especially when it comes to range), but for the inside of a vehicle or other closer confines they light everything up well and with a nice, clear white light.Lastly, I like that they use inexpensive AA batteries and not CR123 ones like my main flashlight.So, what's the down side?  For one, I don't like the toggle switch being how you cycle through the beams (high, low and strobe).  I wish it was only an off\/on switch with a separate one for each cycle as it is on my considerably more expensive light; but for the price I can live with it.Outside of that, these are great \"stashable\" flashlights in that for the price, you can buy many of them and stuff them where you might need them (in the car, in a drawer, in a jacket pocket, etc).  I hope they last, I will be disappointed if they didn't.  Otherwise, I suggest snatching up several of them.Oh, and since they come from Asia, they will take several weeks to show up.

Might be room for a couple more) shines by using an adjustable focus convex lense that delivers a nearly gradient-free light beam that when held three-feet high broadcasts a 24\" diameter, really, truly round light beam. Remember the shadows in other flashlights that seem to hit at exactly the WRONG place? This has none. Period. None.If you need a pinpoint beam, well, this does a darn decent job, too. A user can easily discern individual chunks of pine bark on a tree 50-feet away. At twice that distance the penetrating bean shines well into whatever woods may be in front of it.Already having one spot too many burnt on my retina, I'm not about to try a \"blinding\" light. But I'll bet it does. Enough, one fears, to blind an intruder or attacker. Really. But keep in mind that a youngin' lacking sense may also blind himself or another person.

I used it on the job, working in mechanical and boiler rooms, and it had a couple of moderate falls (4 feet or less). It continued working after those falls, but one day I found it simply wouldn't turn on. Looking inside the battery tube, it looks as if the surface where the positive terminal of the battery is supposed to contact has been worn away. Can't say for sure what happened, but I ordered two to replace it. They are cheap enough that I'd rather have a backup than have one fail and be caught without a light source.These are very tactical looking, but they are NOT built with tactical uses in mind. I certainly wouldn't trust my life to one of these lights. They are great for the money, but you do get what you pay for. Speaking of which, this light is nowhere near 300 lumens on a standard AA alkaline battery. With a lithium battery, it's definitely brighter, but it's still not 300 lumens. I'd highly recommend using a lithium cell with this light, both for the brightness advantages and for the ability to recharge your battery since these will run through a standard AA decently quick.Last thing to mention - I LOVE the beam adjustment of this light. It's extremely easy to operate one-handed, and you can change the focus of the beam very quickly since you are pushing\/pulling the lens assembly instead of turning it. This also lends itself well to being able to maintain a better grip on the light while adjusting the beam. At the tightest focus, you do get a square light pattern like you see in some of the customer images, but I've grown to like that. On a dark night, it's like having a miniature spot light, the beam focuses so tightly.","score":4.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

My take is it's good for extras to throw in the tackle box or glove box, Nice for <$4 stocking stuffers, but of course, not even close to replacing a decent EDC type light (and of course, nowhere near the price). Ok for what it is, worth the price, don't expect more.","score":3.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

If you put the AA battery in there is very dim light. No better than a pen light you can pick up anywhere. If you put in the rechargeable battery, the flashlight only works for 10 minutes, gets hot and quits. I bought the first 3 lights from EggDeal. It took 5 weeks to receive them, and they looked like a quality product. So, I went back to the same location and ordered 5 more, for gifts. In addition I ordered rechargeable batteries and a charger. The 5 I received this time (Tosol 8888) were garbage. No names on the sides, poor paint jobs, dirty lenses and rough machining. The rechargeable batteries wouldn't work in these lights either, and they were even dimmer on AA's than the first batch.Now I' m stuck for the $25 I spent for batteries and a charger, as well as $30 I spent for these lights.

A half push of the button switches modes while a full push turns the light on or off.  The first mode is full brightness, then half brightness, then full brightness but strobe\/blinking mode.  The beam of the light can be focused with a telescopic feature at the head of the light where the bulb is (instead of the typical twist to focus the beam of light).  This method of focusing the light is actually much better for my frequent uses because it is very quick and easy to change how focused I need the light to be (with just two fingers instead of two hands).This flashlight can easily be operated while wearing thick winter gloves.  In the instances when you'll need both hands, this flashlight is just small enough so that you could use your teeth (its heavy so you'll have to bite hard but don't forget metal is tougher than your teeth... unless you WANT to file your teeth down)The light output isn't as bright as some other flashlights in the same price range but this is actually a good thing because I will get much more time out of the battery.  I don't like carrying extra batteries but you'll need to do that with the brighter flashlights because one AA can only give you 2-4hours but this flashlight lets me go about 6+hours before I notice a significant dimmer light.  Costco sells a duracell brand flashlight (pack of 3) for a similar price but that light is even bulkier, heavier, and uses way more batteries.The flashlight is tough enough to be dropped and will fit in your jeans pocket uncomfortably  There are much lighter or brighter flashlights but this is a great value for its price and durability.

You can't guarantee where you are getting your flashlight from unless it is shipped and fulfilled from Amazon. The version I got had an adjustable beam with no company names on the side and was extremely bright just with a standard Duracell battery.

{"name":"Lunix","date":"2014-09-04 00:00:00","text":"I bought a dozen of these and gave about half of them away.  They're solid, and after about a year, are all working as new.  Since I got so many I was able to tell that some of the zooms slide smoothly and easily, others are barely movable.  Zoomed all the way in (smallest beam spread) the beam is nearly square, the same geometry as the LED chip.  That is, the LED chip is projected in detail at full zoom, as you zoom out the beam quickly becomes round.  With a new AA battery, the most tightly zoomed beam will reach over 100 feet with adequate illumination of the target in my opinion.  The word target refers only to whatever is illuminated by the beam, and isn't intended to imply that this light should or could work as a firearm accessory.The mounting clips on some use allen head screws, others use el-cheapo phillips pig iron screws.  I removed the clips from all of them because they are sort of sharp, and in the way.If they were of more consistent quality, I'd give five stars.  However as far as the switches and the illumination, they are nearly identical.  That is a good thing since the switches are solid feeling, and the illumination is even and bright.  They chew through a AA battery pretty fast.  I get about 1.5 hours from a good quality alkaline (i.e. Duracell, Energizer).  I've never had one go out, but they get pretty dim if you don't change the battery soon enough.","score":4.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

It got damp in my daypack during a rainy day and would not work that night on the hike out.  I took it apart the next week. There was obvious moisture\/condensation around the LED. I let it dry out for a week and it started to work again. I believe the problem is with the seal on the focusing\/zoom barrel and in the seal between the lens and the barrel. I put silicon grease on the barrel to give a better seal and super glued the lens in place. Hopefully this will help some, but I never hike with this flashlight without a backup when it is damp weather.UPDATE:  got some more of these, and the second batch is better. The O ring on the zoom is much tighter. Maybe this is a fix, or just an example of loose quality control. If the zoom slides easily -- send it back.

It is not 300 lumens, more like 100 lumens the most.The battery life is adequate. The battery I put in 3 years still works (bought in 2012), I guess that means it doesn't just drain the power when not in use.It is solid aluminum body and does have water proof o-ring. I did not submerge the flashlight, only used it in the rain and it seems to be fine, no electric shock experienced.The ones I received have 3 modes: high, low and burst. HOWEVER, a simple shake of the flashlight changes the mode. For the price, I guess I should not be expecting a shock absorbing button or some sort, still annoying though.You can change the focus of the flashlight but move the lens forward or backward. It will change the throw from a wider area to a more square center spot. AGAIN, the lens just slides, you have to hold it to keep the focus at what you like.For the price, it is not bad, it turn on and stays on. As far as stay in the same mode and focus goes, you probably need to pay more for other flash light...

It works great, it\u2019s small and economical.This flashlight can run on either one of these batteries:* 1 size AA (regular 1.5v battery), easy to find and cheap.or* 1 size 14500 (3.7v battery), harder to find and more expensive, but brighter.Depending on the battery you use, the light is dimmer or brighter:a) On a single AA battery, I would estimate 130 lumens.  To me this is very bright on a single regular battery. I compared to another light I have that is advertized as 130 lumens by Energizer, it is very close to the same brightness in my opinion.  To me 130 lumens is great task lighting.b) On a single 14500 battery, the company claims 300 lumens and I believe it.  300 lumens is INTENSE, probably TOO much for task lighting.  You likely would like this more for walking in the dark, where the light is out away from you more.Other points:a) Uses a 3 click switch.  Press once for full brightness.  Press quickly twice for1\/2 brightness.  3 times for fast blinking at full bright.b) The front of the flashlight pulls in\/out to focus the beam.  It works well and stays where you put it.c) The light color is a slight shift towards blue from absolute white.  But nothing extreme.d) Has a tail cap pushbutton switch is encased in rubber. This is great for one-handed operation.e) Doesn't easily do \"momentary on\". Momentary on is when it comes on by slightly pressing the switch and goes off when you release it. This light comes on when you release the button, not when you push it down. Fellow flashlight geeks call that a \"reverse clicky\".f) Says it\u2019s water resistant, but I doubt it is water proof.  However, I didn\u2019t dunk test it for water proof for fear of ruining it.","score":5.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

A bright, reliable flashlight that can slip into a pocket is a must for us.Shipping was fast with Amazon Prime and the packaging was excellent.  These flashlights did not come with batteries, but I had some on hand for the flashlights we already own.These flashlights are lightweight and very, very bright.  The adjustable beam allows us to search the woods quickly and then to pinpoint what we're searching for.  Most recently that was a wild raccoon who was tipping our waste cans and stealing food from the barn cats.The clips are strong, enabling us to ensure that the flashlights won't fall out of our pockets while we're working.I have absolutely no complaints and intend to buy these again!","score":5.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

My son loves the handy built-in clip; he can clip the flashlight to his pant pocket, on his shirt or where ever it fancies him.

Extending the collar took a greater amount of effort over the first one and it snapped back upon releasing it. If there's an o-ring inside, it's too snug and is creating vacuum on extension. It doesn't snap back all the way leaving about one-eighth inch gap. The only way I could retract it all the way was by rotating the collar as I pressed down and as I pulled up. Eventually I could fully extend it and retract it with no issues. The same flashlight had a short issue with the switch. One day upon pressing the on-off button it flashed on momentarily then remained off. Pushing down on the button had no effect and the switch would not lock in position. It wouldn't even rotate to the next position. I Removed the switch portion from the main body and tapped it on a table and tried pressing again. No change. I eventually screwed the switch back figuring that it was broken. After screwing it back on I tried  pushing the button one last time. It worked again! Probably some debris inside the switch worked free. I was going to ask the seller for a new switch as the problem could occur again at some inconvenient future time.","score":4.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

'cause, you know, you're so likely to face that \"tactical\" situation.)Other quibblette is that it'd be nice to be able to remove the pocket-clip (but it's attached with 2 unusual screws). On the other hand, if it was removed, then the flashlight would roll freely on any surface on which one might lay it - which would NOT be \"desirable\".

Easy to carry in a purse, pack, coat pocket, or car.  I use these with the mini butterball 14500 batteries.  The total cost for the flashlights, batteries, and charger is about $20 for two.  I like the strobe mode for use as an emergency signal.  My only \"beef\" with the flashlight industry in general is the black color.  Seriously?  The point of a flashlight is to improve visibility in the darkness.  Try finding a jet black flashlight during a power outage!  Flashlights should be neon yellow or orange.  I don't care what they look like.  I want something I can easily find and use.  Please stop making black colored flashlights or provide options.","score":4.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

Something is rattling around inside, it won't zoom in all the way any more, and there are two rubber band like things that (I'm guessing) used to be inside the flashlight and are very likely related to why it isn't working any more.  My work backpack has a pocket on the shoulder strap. It had been in that pocket for maybe a month before I discovered it had broken.This flashlight is not rugged. Not even a little.  If clipping it on an office worker's backpack for a month breaks something... Well let's just say I'm glad I didn't get into a situation where I was relying on this light. Very glad.Oh, and nothing at all on this product offering about warranty, how to return it, etc.  Honestly, I wouldn't accept a replacement. Only a refund.One other and less important gripe: The pocket clip is way too rigid and is really hard to get on anything.  That's why I put it on the pocket on my backpack shoulder strap. I couldn't even get the clip over the edge of my jeans pocket without using a tool to pry it open.Move on...get something else. Anything.

At first I was very happy with the brightness, but after 2-3wks. the light would require many clicks of the switch to turn on. Then it would go dark during my trip, and afterwards it wouldn't come on at all. This started after a total use of less than 3hrs. in strobe function, and the battery still had plenty of charge.

If you turn it off and on you will have bright light, dimmer light, and the strobe mode and it's somewhat annoying when you're trying to just use a damn flashlight and have to turn it off and on just to get the right light or at least not turn on in strobe mode.

I've left off 1 of the 5 stars for 2 main reasons detailed in PRO's\/CON's list below:CONS:1- Without (very) fresh batteries, the luminosity quoted in the product description isn't consistently provided by these lights- except on full, fresh batteries, the light is much dimmer than it can be when the light has fully powered batteries in it, so you'll end up going through batteries faster than normal (thankfully, the \"Amazon Basics\" AA batteries are very good quality & are very cheap compared to name-brands, so this is a solveable issue, just wasteful, seeing as you end up tossing batteries which still hold some charge- I've ended up using the 1\/2 dead flashlight batteries in my cable box remotes in an effort not to waste them).2- Like many of the economical flashlights being sold of this design type, sometimes the power-button press to cycle between modes happens without your input, turning on the strobe setting or the lower light output setting without my intending to do so by pressing the power button.PROS:1- These lights are very compact, yet with fully charged batteries, they have a high light output for their size. Given the amount of light they provide when fully powered, they do a good job to the point that my wife always keeps one in her purse & her car for being about at night &\/or walking our dog after dark.2- Unlike many of the other flashlights I've bought of this design\/type, these lights have held up quality-wise over a decent amount of use- working just as they well as they did when they'd 1st arrived.3- The price asked would be inexpensive for 1 CREE-type LED light of this design & high quality, so very good value for a 2 pack!Overall I certainly recommend them if you're looking for a good, low-cost & compact CREE-type LED, zoomable flashlight which works well & is of good quality..","score":4.0,"name_tag":"Top Contributor: Pets"}

The monetary trade off is ridiculous with regards to what you get for your hard earned cash. They rest comfortably in the palm of your hand with intuitive motions to light up. Only thing I can't for the life of me figure out is why there's a strobe setting,  but that's just me maybe needing a clue as to a real world application.

{"name":"James G. Demian","date":"2018-04-10 00:00:00","text":"Wow.  Nicely made.  Work very well with Li Ion 14500 batteries as well as with AA alkaline (of course dimmer).  Not hard to get used to the (stupid) inclusion of Strobe Mode.  They automatically cycle from mode to mode each time you turn them off\/on with the tail switch.  Hint to make your life easier (such as it is): When (not if) it turns on automatically (every third time) in strobe mode, just gently push down slightly once or twice on the switch to make it cycle between modes to get what you want.  Instead of \"jumping up and down, screaming and shouting\", just think ZEN thoughts (Ooooommmm.  All is beauty) and gently depress the switch.And think of the amazingness of this: A bright (and cheap and well-made) LED flashlight that operates on one lousy battery at 1 1\/2 volts (yes, even cheap light \"heavy duty\" non-alkalines) or an NiMH rechargeable at 1.35 volts and yet is still not destroyed by 3.7 volt Li Ion's.  Would I be as enthusiastic if I'd not got them on sale at 6.99?  Well, maybe a little less because the competition in quantity goes for about $3 to $4 per, and if I buy 5 or 6, I'd be giving away a few to friends and that would be even more fun.One little nit-picky thing: the \"Two Fluorescent Rings Which Shine in the Dark Night\" (not fluorescent but phosphorescent) the \"rings\" seem to be just those (cheap) little silicone rubber bands sold in handi-craft stores that are woven together (mainly by younger people, it seems) to make rings and bracelets.  Yeah, some of those are sold as glow-in-the-dark.  My point is that after a few minutes in the dark, I've seen matches brighter than these -yeah UNLIT matches!One more thing - if you use 14500 Li Ion batteries:\u00a0EBL 14500 Li-ion Rechargeable Batteries 3.7V 800mAh for LED Flashlight Torch, 8 Packs\u00a0most of these are what is called \"unprotected\".  In this case, it means if their voltage goes down in the flashlight, they are probably going to be damaged and may never again be able to be charged to full capacity - or at all.  So this is my suggestion: if the \"bulb\" starts dimming or shuts off by itself: immediately open the flashlight and take out the battery.  That way the flashlight cannot draw down its voltage any more.  Since there's no circuit to protect your battery, you have to do it.  This should help you protect your investment and continue to give you the nice bright light these batteries give with these flashlights.","score":5.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

They are a lot sturdier than I would have thought for the price, and they have the flashing lights that would be of use if we find ourselves stranded out at night.","score":5.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}

{"name":"Gene H.","date":"2018-04-11 00:00:00","text":"We were looking for a decent flashlight for outdoor use - primary in the back yard to spot the pets or other critters.  I took a shot at these since they were on sale. They arrived and we kinda laughed thinking they wouldn't do the job.We were wrong.  Our back yard goes back 80 feet or so.  This thing lights it up in spot mode or the more open mode.  It's great.  I'll be picking up a couple more.","score":5.0,"name_tag":"no tag"}
